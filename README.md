# Front End Stories

### Nav Bar Functionality
* Nav Bar was first set up to only reference points on the home page.  My task was to change these links to dynamic links using the django template language.

### Template Inheritance
* My task was to work with the base template, and each existing app's templates to create a consistency among the views that followed a proper DOM model.
